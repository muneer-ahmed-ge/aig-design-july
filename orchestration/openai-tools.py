# Business: Conversational Agents to answer complex questions by calling external APIs
# Problem : Convert natural language into API calls
# Solution : OpenAI Function-Calling

# Notes
# OpenAI termed the capability to invoke a single function as functions, and the capability to invoke one or more functions as tools.
# If youâ€™re creating agents using OpenAI models, you should be using this OpenAI Tools agent rather than the OpenAI functions agent.
# Using tools allows the model to request that more than one function will be called upon when appropriate.
# In some situations, this can help significantly reduce the time that it takes an agent to achieve its goal.
