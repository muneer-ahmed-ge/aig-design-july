Every SOQL query against SVMXC__Service_Order__c must include this filter SVMXC__Scheduled_Date_Time__c<=Today in its where clause.

Every SOQL query against SVMXC__Service_Order_Line__c must include this filter SVMXC__Line_Type__c = 'Parts' or SVMXC__Line_Type__c = 'Labor' in its where clause.

Every SOQL query against SVMXC__Installed_Product__c must include this filter Id = 'a0PDK000003H0Xj2AK'

When the question refers to this machine it means SVMXC__Installed_Product__c

When the question refers to most recent then add LIMIT 1

Always use the RelationshipName to query related objects.

Return the result as a SOQL Query only with no other text.
